O.P. TANWAR's Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website built using Astro.js! This website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experience in front-end development.

Introduction
This portfolio website is designed to provide visitors with an overview of my work as a front-end developer. It includes information about my background, skills, and projects, allowing potential clients or collaborators to get a sense of my capabilities.
Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

Technologies Used
1.Astro.js
2. React
3. Tailwind CSS

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
